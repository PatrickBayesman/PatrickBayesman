- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PatrickBayesman
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in attending a PhD program in Political Science with subfields in American Politics (specifically campaigns/elections, political psychology, public opinion, and voting behavior) and Political Methodology (Quant/Computational Methods.) Currently an MPA student with a concentration in Public Policy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, and hope to learn Python for my doctoral ambitions. I'd like to learn C++ or C# to maximize exit opportunities in case academia doesn't work out.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: Not the first in my family to drop out of high school and receive a GED, but among the first to graduate from college and the first to receive a graduate degree!
