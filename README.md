- 👋 Hi, I’m @PatrickBayesman
- 👀 I’m interested in attending a PhD program in Political Science with subfields in American Politics (specifically campaigns/elections, political psychology, public opinion, and voting behavior) and Political Methodology (Quant/Computational Methods.) Currently an MPA student with a concentration in Public Policy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, and hope to learn Python for my doctoral ambitions. I'd like to learn C++ or C# to maximize exit opportunities in case academia doesn't work out.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not the first in my family to drop out of high school, but among the first to graduate from college and the first to receive a graduate degree!
